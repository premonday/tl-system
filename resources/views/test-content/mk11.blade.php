            <h2>Mortal Kombat 11 Best Characters Tier List</h2>
            <p>Mortal Kombat 11 has just been released! Here you can see a tier list of the best characters. The S
                Tier shows the best characters, incrementally getting worse as the tiers decrease. Our MK 11 Tier
                List will be updated as the meta changes. Additional DLC characters will be added to the tier list
                as they become available.</p>

<h2>Mortal Kombat 11 Tier List</h2>
<p>This Mortal Kombat 11 Best Characters Tier List has been constructed with the help of beta testers, pro players and careful speculation. This Character Tier List will be updated frequently over the coming months as the game progresses and updates. Our Best Characters Tier List scales from S Tier to D Tier. D Tier shows the characters that are considered to be a bit underpowered in the current meta while S Tier shows the best characters in Mortal Kombat 11.</p>
